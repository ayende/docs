# Storing data in index

After the [tokenization and analysis](../indexes/using-analyzers) process is complete, the resulting tokens are stored in an index, which is now ready to be search with. Only fields in the final index projection could be used for searches, and the actual tokens stored for each depends on how the selected Analyzer processed the original text.

Lucene allows storing the original token text for fields, and RavenDB exposes this feature in the index definition object via `Stores`.

By default, tokens are saved to the index as _Indexed and Analyzed_ but not _Stored_ - that is: they can be searched on using a specific Analyzer (or the default one), but their original value is unavailable after indexing. Enabling field storage causes values to be available for retrieval via [ProjectFromIndexFieldsInto](../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-projection#projectfromindexfieldsinto), [transformers](../transformers/what-are-transformers) or [other](../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-projection) projection functions, and is done like so:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:AbstractIndexCreationTask storing_1@Indexes\Storing.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Commands storing_2@Indexes\Storing.cs /}
{CODE-TABS/}

## Remarks

{INFO Default value in `Stores` for each field is `FieldStorage.No`. Keep in mind that storing fields will increase disk space required by an index. /}

{INFO If **projection function only requires fields that are stored**, then document will not be loaded from storage and all data will come from index directly. This can increase query performance (by the cost of disk space used) in many situations when whole document is not needed. /}
